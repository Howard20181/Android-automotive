# Android-automotive

Some change for an Android 11 head unit.

Unfortunately, it bricked and there is no recovery firmware available.

Later, I bought a new 7870-DUDUAUTO.

## Get root for 7870-DUDUAUTO

Like many other head units, it has permissive SELinux, which is equivalent to having root privileges enabled by default.

1. Download and install Magisk official or Magisk Alpha.
2. Download and install Magica with Magisk Alpha support added from <https://github.com/Howard20181/Magica/releases/latest>.
3. Launch Magica and tap the Install button at the bottom.
4. Reboot and enjoy root privileges.
